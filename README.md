Front-end challenge which i consume an users api.

https://reqres.in/

To test youll have to use this credentials:

`Email` eve.holt@reqres.in

`Password` cityslicka


## Features

- BEM methodology (with SCSS)
- Modular structure
- NO libraries (only axios)
- Some lifecycle hooks (few because of the requisites)
- Conditional rendering
- etc..
## Improvements

- I could add controls for login and register forms... so client has more idea of what is wrong exactly.

- Adding a more robust styling would be very good. 

- In general, the project could be more complex...
